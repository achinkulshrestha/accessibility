<p>The internet is an indispensable resource in our lives; people use it everyday in the context of entertainment, healthcare, education, leveraging it to solve really hard problems. By law, websites and mobile applications need to be accessible in order to provide tantamount access and opportunity to the visually impaired. Web content can be accessed with the help of “screen readers”- these applications read the printed text out loud, which helps people with vision problems use computers and receive easy access to text content on the web. However, for these systems to be effective, the underlying web application needs to be structured well. This focuses attention on the application development approaches followed by web developers. In our research, we studied the application development process of professional web developers to understand their view on accessibility. Based on our findings, we built a tool called - Vibl, which provides feedback to web developers on the accessibility of their application as they build it. We also demonstrate the gamification component of Vibl, which has been designed to inculcate a sense of competition among developers and motivate them to create accessible websites. We evaluate Vibl's design by collecting users’ subjective response on the tool.</p>

<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>Gamification
Most of the participant interviews reflected lack of motivation in the web development community towards improving accessibility of the applications they were building. Vibl’s gamification component compares the score of the application under test with other developers using Vibl around the world. </p>

<p>Powerful Accessibility Checker Engine
Vibl follows strict W3C guidelines to find accessibility issues in the website. </p>

<p>Easy Access to guidelines
Supporting the Vibl tool is a website, which shows accessibility guidelines along with examples.</p>

<p>Guideline for the day
A new accessibility guideline is shown in Vibl daily to support learning.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-a-chrome-extension" class="anchor" href="#why-a-chrome-extension" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why a Chrome Extension?</h2>

<p>Simplicity
In our interviews we found that professional developers use browser extensions heavily.  Chrome developer tools is a critical component of a web developers arsenal, so it made a lot of sense to augment the Chrome developer panel with Vibl.</p>

<p>Extensibility
Vibl uses a Javascript library that performs all the accessibility checks. Vibl’s modular framework makes it really easy to add more complex checks and  techniques to improve its overall effectiveness. Chrome updates also make it really easy to push update to Vibl over the internet.</p>

<p>Platform Independence
The biggest benefit of using a browser ecosystem for Vibl is that it is independent of the underlying operating system. It is also relatively easy to port Vibl for other browsers which support extensions like Mozilla.</p>
