{"name":"Project Vibl","tagline":"Feedback tool for web developers to improve the accessibility of applications they build","body":"## Introduction\r\nThe internet is an indispensable resource in our lives; people use it everyday in the context of entertainment, healthcare, education, leveraging it to solve really hard problems. By law, websites and mobile applications need to be accessible in order to provide tantamount access and opportunity to the visually impaired. Web content can be accessed with the help of “screen readers”- these applications read the printed text out loud, which helps people with vision problems use computers and receive easy access to text content on the web. However, for these systems to be effective, the underlying web application needs to be structured well. This focuses attention on the application development approaches followed by web developers. In our research, we studied the application development process of professional web developers to understand their view on accessibility. Based on our findings, we built a tool called - Vibl, which provides feedback to web developers on the accessibility of their application as they build it. We also demonstrate the gamification component of Vibl, which has been designed to inculcate a sense of competition among developers and motivate them to create accessible websites. We evaluate Vibl's design by collecting users’ subjective response on the tool.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nGamification\r\nMost of the participant interviews reflected lack of motivation in the web development community towards improving accessibility of the applications they were building. Vibl’s gamification component compares the score of the application under test with other developers using Vibl around the world. \r\n\r\nPowerful Accessibility Checker Engine\r\nVibl follows strict W3C guidelines to find accessibility issues in the website. \r\n\r\nEasy Access to guidelines\r\nSupporting the Vibl tool is a website, which shows accessibility guidelines along with examples.\r\n\r\nGuideline for the day\r\nA new accessibility guideline is shown in Vibl daily to support learning.\r\n\r\n## Why a Chrome Extension?\r\nSimplicity\r\nIn our interviews we found that professional developers use browser extensions heavily.  Chrome developer tools is a critical component of a web developers arsenal, so it made a lot of sense to augment the Chrome developer panel with Vibl.\r\n\r\nExtensibility\r\nVibl uses a Javascript library that performs all the accessibility checks. Vibl’s modular framework makes it really easy to add more complex checks and  techniques to improve its overall effectiveness. Chrome updates also make it really easy to push update to Vibl over the internet.\r\n\r\nPlatform Independence\r\nThe biggest benefit of using a browser ecosystem for Vibl is that it is independent of the underlying operating system. It is also relatively easy to port Vibl for other browsers which support extensions like Mozilla.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\n* Displaying line of code for each Accessibility failure\r\n* Intelligent gamification support.\r\n* Examples for each guideline\r\n* Lint rule for developers\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
